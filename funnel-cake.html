    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) in a heavy skillet.</p>

    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    <p>Beat milk and eggs together in a large bowl. Combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture until smooth.</p>

    <h5>Step 3</h5>
    <p>Use your finger to cover the funnel hole; pour in 1 cup of batter. Starting in the center of the skillet, remove your finger and move the funnel in a swirling motion to make a 6- or 7-inch round. Fry in hot oil until bottom is golden brown; flip and continue cooking until golden brown all over, about 1 minute per side. Drain on paper towels. Continue cooking remaining batter.</p>

    <h5>Step 4</h5>
    <p>Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and serve warm.
